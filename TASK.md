## Quick Start for Next Phase

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1):
1. Test current sound system: `echo '{"session_id": "test"}' | uv run python3 notification.py`
2. Check Discord webhook is working in your server
3. Enhance notification messages with more context
4. Add error handling for webhook failures

### Phase 2 Prerequisites:
1. Discord Developer Portal access
2. Server admin permissions to add bot
3. Understanding of Discord bot permissions
4. Basic testing of bot functionality

---

## Commands for Phase Management

### Check Current Status:
```bash
python3 test_hooks.py
```

### Start Phase 2 (Bidirectional):
```bash
python3 start_bidirectional.py
```

### Test Individual Components:
```bash
# Test notifications
echo '{"session_id": "test"}' | uv run python3 notification.py

# Test bot (when configured)
python3 discord_bot.py

# Test monitor
python3 claude_monitor.py
```

## Notes
- Each phase can be implemented independently
- Phases 1-3 are core functionality
- Phases 4-6 are enhancements and polish
- Some tasks may be optional based on your needs
- Always test thoroughly before moving to next phase
